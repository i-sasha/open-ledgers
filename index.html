      <p id="h1r">What is Bookkeeping?</p>
      <p id="h3-b">It is the process of Systematic Classifying, Recording and Organizing of all Financial Transactions of a Business or a Person.
							Daily transactions are recorded in Journal(s).<br />Monthly totals are then Posted to the Ledger. The ledger is basically a Chart of 
							Accounts. <br />An account is a unique record for each type of asset, liability, equity, revenue and expense.<br />Based on the information 
							in the ledger, Financial Statements are produced on a periodic basis. Most commonly used statements are Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, and 
							Cash Flow. </p><br />

      <p id="h1r">Why keep your financial records in an organized and up-to-date state?</p>
		<p id="h3-b">For Bookkeeping Records to be useful, they need to be updated on a regular basis, so they reflect current and accurate information. 
							Good record keeping is a legal requirement.<br />Reliable information is of utmost importance for good business decision making.<br /> 
							Up-to-date records save time and accounting fees, when it comes to taxes.</p><br />
